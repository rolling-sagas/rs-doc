# NovelAI
## Overview
[NovelAI](https://novelai.net/) is an AI-assisted writing platform, on which users can write stories and enjoy text adventures.

The text adventure mode is just like AI Dungeon. Users can input actions to intereact with AI.

However, the created stories can't be 'played'. From my point of view, it's more like a self writing platform than a game play platform.
