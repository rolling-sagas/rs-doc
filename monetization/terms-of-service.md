You acknowledge that: (a) we may store and continue charging your payment method (e.g., credit card) to ensure uninterrupted access to the Services, and (b) we may determine the taxes you owe based on the billing information you provide at the time of purchase. We reserve the right to modify our subscription plans or adjust pricing at our sole discretion.

All payments must be made in accordance with the payment terms in effect at the time the subscription is due. You may pay using a credit card, debit card, or any other methods we offer.

We may revise or change the pricing, availability, specifications, content, descriptions, or features of any Offerings at any time. While we strive to provide accurate descriptions of Offerings, we do not guarantee that descriptions are complete, reliable, current, or error-free.

We reserve the right to update prices, correct pricing errors, and cancel orders at our discretion if pricing errors occur. All changes will take effect immediately upon posting new prices or notifying customers of pricing errors.

## Dispute Resolution
If we have a dispute, we would first like to understand and try to address your concerns before any formal legal action. To share your concerns you can contact us at support@rollingsagas.com. The parties will first try in good faith to settle any Dispute within 30 days after the Dispute arises. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days, it shall be resolved by arbitration by the **American Arbitration Association’s International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with its Expedited Commercial Rules in force as of the date of this Agreement ("Rules"). The parties will mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in English in Santa Clara County, California, USA.** Either party may apply to any competent court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of the arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with the remedies and limitations in the Agreement. The arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court, including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property.
Each party will bear its own lawyers’ and experts’ fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator’s final decision regarding the Dispute.
