### Your Content License Grant
In connection with your use of the Services, you may be able to post, upload, or submit content to be made available through the Services (“Your Content”).

You agree that these rights and licenses are royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide, and irrevocable (for so long as Your Content is stored with us), and include a right for us to make Your Content available to, and pass these rights along to, others with whom we have contractual relationships related to the provision of the Services, solely for the purpose of providing such Services, and to otherwise permit access to or disclose Your Content to third parties if we determine such access is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.

## Paid Services
If you purchase or subscribe to any of our paid Services, you agree to pay the applicable fees and taxes in U.S. Dollars. If you fail to make these payments, your access to the paid Services will be terminated. You acknowledge that: (a) we may store and continue charging your payment method (e.g., credit card) to ensure uninterrupted access to the Services, and (b) we may determine the taxes you owe based on the billing information you provide at the time of purchase. We reserve the right to modify our subscription plans or adjust pricing at our sole discretion. Unless otherwise specified, any changes in pricing or subscription plans will be communicated to you with reasonable notice. All payments must be made in accordance with the payment terms in effect at the time the subscription is due. You may pay using a credit card, debit card, or any other methods we offer. Subscriptions will not be processed until full payment is received, and any issues with payment processing by other providers are your responsibility.

### Subscription Renewals and Cancellations
By subscribing to a paid portion of our Services, you agree that your subscription will automatically renew at the frequency specified on your subscription page (or monthly if no frequency is specified), and your payment method will be automatically charged for the fees and taxes applicable to each new subscription period. To avoid future charges, you must cancel your subscription, which will be effective at the end of your current subscription period. You can manage your subscription and cancel it through the subscription settings on your Profile page.

### Refund Policy
We offer refunds for up to 14 days for annual plan subscription or 3 days for monthly plan if your used credits are no more than 400.

If your local law requires a longer refund eligibility period, then the longer time period will apply.（需确认各个国家的退款政策）

Credits issued for the current month are non-refundable. Fees for used months are charged at full price. Send an email with your login email address to support@rollingsagas.com.

We reserve the right to amend, modify, or rescind this Refund Policy at any time, without prior notice, as deemed necessary in the course of business operations.

### Payment
The Services may allow you to buy physical or digital items, including products or services from third parties offered through the Services. You agree that all information you provide for purchasing, such as credit card details or other payment information, is accurate, current, and complete. You confirm that you have the legal right to use the payment method you provide, including any credit card used for the transaction. We reserve the right, with or without notice and at our sole discretion, to (a) discontinue, modify, or limit the availability of any Offerings, and (b) refuse to allow any user to purchase or receive any Offering or deliver it to a designated address. By purchasing Offerings, you (a) agree to pay the listed price for those Offerings as specified in the Service, and (b) authorize us (or our payment processor, such as Stripe) to charge your credit card or other payment method for the full amount. Unless otherwise specified, all amounts are in U.S. Dollars. Fees and charges must be paid according to the terms in effect when they are due. Payment options include credit card, debit card, or other methods provided by us. Orders will not be processed until full payment is received, and any issues with payment processing are your responsibility.

### Changes and Pricing
We may revise or change the pricing, availability, specifications, content, descriptions, or features of any Offerings at any time. While we strive to provide accurate descriptions of Offerings, we do not guarantee that descriptions are complete, reliable, current, or error-free. The availability of any Offering does not imply it will be available in the future. We reserve the right to update prices, correct pricing errors, and cancel orders at our discretion if pricing errors occur. All changes will take effect immediately upon posting new prices or notifying customers of pricing errors.

### Order Confirmation
Once we receive your order for an Offering, we will provide you with an order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation, however, does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. We reserve the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason and at our sole discretion. If we cancel an order after you have already been billed, then we will refund the billed amount.

## Dispute Resolution（需重点确认仲裁办法）
If we have a dispute, we would first like to understand and try to address your concerns before any formal legal action. To share your concerns you can contact us at support@rollingsagas.com. The parties will first try in good faith to settle any Dispute within 30 days after the Dispute arises. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days, it shall be resolved by arbitration by the **American Arbitration Association’s International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with its Expedited Commercial Rules in force as of the date of this Agreement ("Rules"). The parties will mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in English in Santa Clara County, California, USA.** Either party may apply to any competent court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of the arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with the remedies and limitations in the Agreement. The arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court, including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property.
Each party will bear its own lawyers’ and experts’ fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator’s final decision regarding the Dispute.
