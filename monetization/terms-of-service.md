## Dispute Resolution and Governing Law

In the event a dispute, controversy, or claim arises out of or relating to these Terms (“Dispute”), the Dispute will be resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court. The parties will first try in good faith to settle any Dispute within 30 days after the Dispute arises. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days, it shall be resolved by arbitration by the **American Arbitration Association’s International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with its Expedited Commercial Rules** in force as of the date of this Agreement ("Rules"). The parties will mutually select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in English in Santa Clara County, California, USA. Either party may apply to any competent court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of the arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with the remedies and limitations in the Agreement. The arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court, including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property.
Each party will bear its own lawyers’ and experts’ fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator’s final decision regarding the Dispute.

We provide the service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about it.

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however they arise.

You are responsible for Your use of the service. If You harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.

To the extent permitted by law, you will indemnify and hold us
harmless, our affiliates, and our personnel, from and against any costs, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) from third party claims arising out of or relating to your use of the Services and Assets or any violation of these Terms.
