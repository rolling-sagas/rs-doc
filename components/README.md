# Components

**Overview:** THe new update will transform our current platform into a version where **creators** have more freedom to shape their story. In order to do that, we will be introducing a new system called **components**. These act as bricks that can be inserted or removed based on the creator's preference. 

Before we give the players free reign, we will develop a **complete template** for them based on the TTRPG **Call of Cthulhu**. The template will include all **necessary components**, and will set as an example of how their story can be built and shaped. 

- *A good example will be **Roblox**, where if a creator wants to build a FPS game on their platform, Roblox already has a FPS template ready for the player to build on.*
