# Components

**Overview:** THe new update will transform our current platform into a version where **creators** have more freedom to shape their story. In order to do that, we will be introducing a new system called **components**. These act as bricks that can be inserted or removed based on the creator's preference. 

Before we give the players free reign, we will develop a **complete template** for them based on the TTRPG **Call of Cthulhu**. The template will include all **necessary components**, and will set as an example of how their story can be built and shaped. 

- *A good example will be **Roblox**, where if a creator wants to build a FPS game on their platform, Roblox already has a FPS template ready for the player to build on.*



## What we have now:

### Chapter Components:

- Initial Message

- Max Turns

- Rules

- Images: *We can currently have multiple images within a single chapter. Furthermore, we can also command it to utilize specific images at specific moments*

- Skill Check

- Skill Choice

### Investigator Components:

- Name

- Occupation

- Backstory

- Characteristics

- Occupational Skills

- Image (Investigator Portrait)



## What we Need:

### Introduction:
**Essentially similar to "RollingSagas"**

- Story/Scenario Name

- Publish Button

- Story/Scenario Name Description:


### Chapter Components:

- Initial Chapter: *We will need this to dictate where the session should **begin***

- Create Chapter: *Players will need to be able to create a new chapter (Max number of chapters?)*

- Chapter Transition: *Chapters needs to be connected, and be able to go from chapter 1 --> 2 --> 3... etc.*

- Chapter Name:

- BGM: *A melody that is looped during gameplay (we need 2 layers for this, the other one is SFX that are repetitive)*

- Audio Output: *AI outputs audio sounds (e.g. creepy screams)*

- Audio Narrator: *AI narrator*

- Video Output: *AI outputs generated video (e.g. Creepy monster approaching)*

- Choices Audio Output: *Sound effects played every time the player makes a decision.*

- Regeneration Button: *For instances when the generated content is broken*

- Dice SFX: *Dice needs sound effects when rolling on the board*

- Death: *We need a restart button (either from the chapter or  story)*

- Public Edit: *Need a button to allow or disallow players to copy the story data and edit themselves*

- 


### Combat

- Window: *We will need a window of some sort to display combat*

- Character Sprites: *We need a sprite to represent player's investigator (with variability)*

- Enemy Sprites: *Obviously enemy will also need sprites*

- Animation: *Does not need to be complex, but required to enhanced the overall combat experience (Note that there will also be spells)*

- Sprite Positions: *Essentially the position of the sprites*

- Background: *There will need to be a background of some sort during combat*

- Status Effects: *Both player and enemies can potentially inflict status effects (Bleed, poison, Burn, etc.)*

- HP/MP/SAN: *Will need to be displayed to the player at all times*

- Dice roll occurs **during** combat. Results are then sent to AI afterwards (dice roll result must be able to affect the animation)

### Sanity

- Sprite for character going insane



## Player Character & Sessions

**Overview:** As our platform continues to transform, it is imperative to decide on how the session should begin. Given that there are no clear answers at the moment, I suggest we play test to see which experience is better.

### Proposal A: 

Players will create their own **investigator** which they would use to **populate** any scenario they would like to play.
- If the player would like to play as an alternative investigator (alternate occupation, skills, appearance etc.), they will just need to create another pre-set in their profile.

- **This will be more similar to ROBLOX**

### Proposal B:

After selecting a **scenario**, players may **change** their **investigator** that they would like to roleplay as for that specific scenario. 
- Default will always be the **last played** investigator. 

- There are multiple pre-sets in the profile.

- **Players** can also choose to roleplay as a **story specific** investigator.

- **This will be more similar to CoC TTRPG (And Rollingsagas)**

### Proposal C: 

Players will only have **visual representation** of their characters (Only the face). The investigator, occupation, and stats etc. are all determined by the **creator** for that **session**.
- There can be multiple investigators available to select from.

- Furthermore, the players can also **only** inherit the stats, of the **story specific character**, leaving the visuals exactly the way they like it.

- **This will be more convenient for quick start**






### Investigator Components:

- Age: *A Modifier which alters character stats*

- Custom Character: *We need a system where a player can create their own character*

- Character Population: *This refers to the story/scenario allowing the players to populate their own **investigator***

- Items: *"Consumables" and "key items" (will need a list for both)*

- Equipment: *Weapons (They will need variety and stats)*

- Inventory: *A "space" for investigators to carry their items*

- Investigator Data Sheet: *Player needs to be able to review their character data sheet at any time during gameplay*

## Additional Improvements

### Story Select Experience


- Pinned Image: *All published stories will have a cover that will be pinned on the home page*

- Information: *An "information" section for players to learn what the game is about (Behind underneath a play button)

- Play Transition Page: *The page where the player/user is redirect to once they picked a game. There is a play button and potentially a information section*

- Add a play button on game that is posted by a creator for **ease of access** for players


### Chapter

- Censorship: *When generated contents are censored, we need a way to properly inform the creator or player about the issue (right now it just shows and error and requests the player to regenerate)*
