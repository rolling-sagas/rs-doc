# Enemies

Overview: There will be a wide variety of enemies in the game of Call of Cthulhu. From classical werewolves and zombies, to eldritch abominations and cosmic Gods. Whatever type of enemy the player chooses to include in their story, we need to provide a wide assembly of these "monsters" for them to choose from, build upon, or modify to fit their needs.

*I will call these monsters, beasts, and alien Gods (even other humans) using the general term "enemies".*

## Enemy Library

We will need a library to store these enemies, along with their **STATS**, **ID**, **DESCRIPTION**, and **NAME**. When needed, the **Creators** can select whichever enemy they want to appear in their story. 

Each Enemy will have the below information:

### Example:

| ID: | Name: | Description: | STR: | CON: | SIZE: | DEX: | POW: | HP: | DMG BONUS: | BUILD: | MP: | MOV: | ATK / RND: | ATK | ARMOR | SAN LOSS: |
:-- | :-: | :-: |:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |--:
001 | Zombie | Walking Dead | 80 | 80 | 65 | 35 | 05 | 14 | 1D4 | 1 | 1 | 6 | 1 | 30%, 1D3 + DMG Bonus | - | 0 / 1D8


As you can see, there are many **stats** that go into an enemy, similar to characters, but they are necessary since they are taken into account during **combat**. 

### Notes:

-  **Creators** are allowed to edit these stats, and names as they see fit. So make sure an edit function is built into it.

- Some enemies can use weapons (swords, staves, etc.)
