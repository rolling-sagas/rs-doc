Standard plan users receive 60 daily login credit rewards during subscription period. Monthly allowance credits reset to 700 every month starting from your subscription date. Unused monthly credits will not roll over to next month.

Advanced plan users have unlimited credits during subscription period.

## Manage Your Plan

### Switch Plans

You can upgrade your plan at any time. When upgrading, you can choose whether the upgrade should be effective immediately or at the end of the current billing cycle. If you choose to upgrade immediately, you will be offered a prorated price based on the usage of the plan you are upgrading from. The next billing date will be based on the expiration date of the new plan.

Downgrades are always effective at the end of the current billing cycle.

### Automatic Renewal
- Unused monthly credits does not roll over.
- Your payment method on file with our third party payment processor will be automatically charged at the end of each monthly or annual billing period.

### Cancellation
You can cancel automatic renewal by navigating to **Profile > View My Plan**. 
Cancellations are effective at the end of the current billing cycle.

### Refunds
You can request a full refund of your subscription payment for any tier within 14 days after purchasing an annual plan and 3 days after purchasing a monthly plan if your used credits are no more than 400.

If your local law requires a longer refund eligibility period, then the longer time period will apply.
