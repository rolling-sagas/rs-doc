Standard plan users receive 60 daily login credit rewards during subscription period. Monthly allowance credits reset to 700 every month starting from your subscription date. Unused monthly credits will not roll over to next month.

Advanced plan users have unlimited credits during subscription period.

### How can I check my remaining credits?

## Manage Your Plan

### Switch Plans

You can upgrade your plan at any time by navigating to **Profile > Edit profile > My Plan > Change plan**. When upgrading, you can choose whether the upgrade should be effective immediately or at the end of the current billing cycle. If you choose to upgrade immediately, you will be offered a prorated price based on the usage of the plan you are upgrading from. The next billing date will be based on the expiration date of the new plan.

Downgrades are always effective at the end of the current billing cycle.

### Automatic Renewal
- Unused monthly credits does not roll over.
- Your payment method on file with our third party payment processor will be automatically charged at the end of each monthly or annual billing period.

### Cancellation
You can cancel your plan any time by navigating to **Profile > Edit profile > My Plan > Cancel plan**. 
Cancellations are effective at the end of the current billing cycle. However, you'll keep access to all of your subscription features until then.

### Refunds
You can request a full refund of your subscription payment for any tier within 14 days after purchasing an annual plan and 3 days after purchasing a monthly plan if your used credits are no more than 400.

If you are eligible for a refund, you'll see the option to request a refund automatically when you click cancel plan. It may take up to 10 business days for your refund to reach you, depending on your bank's processing times, but you'll get a confirmation email within a few minutes.
