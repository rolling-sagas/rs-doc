# Sanity

## Overview
Sanity reflects the mental state of your investigator's mind. 

Whenever an investigator encounters the horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos or comes across something mundane yet horriffc (such as stumbling across a friendâ€™s mutilated corpse), you will be required to make a [Sanity Check](#sanity-check--roll).

The more it deteriorates, the less stable your investigator's mind become, and when your investigator becomes insane, he/she would possibly inherit a [BOUT OF MADNESS](#bouts-of-madness).


### Cause of Insanity Examples:
- Cthulhu Mythos
- Alien Creatures
- Grotesque Scenes
- Paranormal / Supernatural
- Monsterous Creatures
- Great Old Ones
- Other Worldly Horrors
- Undergo Torture
- Meet someone you know to be dead

And many more... 

Which ever horror is in the story it should affect the investigator's sanity. But how is that calculated?

## Sanity Check & Roll

When your investigator experiences some form of event from the above section, then you will need to **roll** a **1D100** die against the investigator's **current** sanity point* to determine the **potential amount** of sanity points he/she would lose.

**Your sanity points should be calculated based on the **"POW"** characteristics.*

### Sanity Loss

Sanity Losses are described something like this: 

- 0 / 1D6

- 2 / 1D10

- 1 / 1D4 + 1

The slash seperates the initial **SANITY CHECK** your character has made. **LEFT** side of the slash is the sanity loss when the character made a **successful** sanity check. Where as the **RIGHT** side of the slash represents the sanity loss when the character **failed** their sanity check.

Thus:
- If you roll over, you will lose a greater amount of sanity.
- If you roll under, you will lose less sanity or none at all.

If your characters sanity points **drop** to **1/5** of your maximum, then the character will inherit a **BOUT OF MADNESS**.

Alternatively...

If your character loses **5 or more** sanity points from one roll (as in, an event or instance), then they would also need to make an **INT** roll to determine if they would inherit a bout of madness.
- If they **FAIL** this roll, then they **have not** gone insane (*A trick the mind uses to protect itself*)
- But if they **SUCCEED** the roll, then they will inherit a **BOUT OF MADNESS** (*The character was able to comprehend what they saw*). 

## Bouts of Madness

When the character has gone insane, they would behave in certain way, this is what bouts of madness essentially is. During gameplay, when the player's character succumbs to insanity, they **roll** a **1D6** to determine a random bouts of madness exhibited by the character. 

List of our bouts of madness:

1. **Physical Hysterics or Emotional Outbursts:** Laughing, crying, screaming, while speaking strangely.

2. **Violence:** During combat, the character will ONLY fight. They cannot not use items or flee.

3. **Flee in Panic:** During combat, the character will always flee. They cannot use items or fight. 

5. **Paranoia:** Character suffers from paranoia, think they are spied on, tricked, and nothing can be trusted.

6. **Phobias:** Character gains a phobia and even imagines it being there for a few rounds.

7. **Mania:** Character gains a mania and acts on it? Maybe even imagine it?

When the character loses more than or equal to 5 Sanity points, then the character will **roll a 1D6** to gain a random bout of madness. Depending on the madness type, the **effect** may be immediately applied, **or** the character will have to roll again to determine the specifics (e.g. For phobia, there would be another roll to determine the specific phobia the character is experiencing).
