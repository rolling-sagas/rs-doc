# Combat

## Overview
When you are confronted with the horrors of the *Cthulhu Mythos*, it is generally a better idea to run away or avoid confrontation altogether, as such entities are very powerful and often resistant to bullets! However, sometimes there is no other choice than to go in, guns blazing, and make the best of it.

## Basic Combat Rules

A COMBAT normally will go through the following steps:

- [Establish Order of Attack](#establish-order-of-attack). 
- Attacker moves first. Defender reacts to Attacker's move.
- Roll and compare levels of success, and decide damage points.
Check out the different situations here:
[If Player Moves First...](#if-player-moves-first)
[If Enemey Moves First...](#if-enemy-moves-first)
- Player and Enemey take turns to attack and defend.
- Combat finishes until one of you is dead or player flees successfully.

## Establish Order of Attack:

When COMBAT begins, the investigator's DEX is compared to the enemy's DEX to determine who has the initiative! Certain characters will have unique perks that may modify their initial DEX value.

- If your investigator has the higher DEX, then you go first!
- If enemy has the higher DEX, enemy attacks first and the investigator must react!

## If Player Moves First...
Player can choose to [Fight](#fight), [Flee](#flee), or use [Items](#items) to recover. 

### Fight:
In terms of the action 'Fight', Player can choose a brawl fight, fight with their simple weapons(if any), or use firearms to fight.

Brawl fight and simple weapon fight require a Fighting skill check. 

> Note that the Fighting (Brawl) skill includes unarmed combat and the use of simple weapons (like knives and clubs); however, wielding a sword requires the Fighting (Sword) specialization.

Using firearms requires a specific firearms skill. If firing 2 or 3 shots from a handgun in one round, apply one penalty die to each shot.
Furthermore, if the player’s character has any relevant perk that would modify the attack probability, apply it here (e.g., “Beady Eye”).

#### Roll for Attack Success
After choosing an attack the investigator will perform (brawl, firearms, fencing*, etc.), player needs to roll for attack success. Only when the attack skill check is success can the investigator actually attacks.

Attack success can be divided into different levels according to your roll result. Level of success determination chart with a D100 is as below.

| Critical Success | Extreme Success        | Hard Success          | Success               | Failure           | Critical Failure |
|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
|       1      | ≤ Skill Value / 5      | ≤ Skill Value / 2     | ≤ Skill Value         | > Skill Value     | 100              |

Player's roll might be influenced by certain conditions: 

1. Fast-moving targets are hard to hit (MOV 8 or more). Shooter receives 1 penalty die.

2. Target's Build:
- If the target’s build is ≤ -2, the shooter receives 1 penalty die.
- If the target’s build is ≥ 4, the shooter receives 1 bonus die.

| Build: ≥ 0       | Build: -1             | Build: -2             | Build: -3             |
|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| None        | 1 Penalty Die                  | 2 Penalty Die         | Impossible         |

#### Determine the Damage Party(等combat最终确定后要修改)

When Enemy is attacked, Enemy will always fight back.

To determine which party will evetually deal damage, simply compare the attacker’s chosen fighting skill against the target/defender’s chosen fighting skill.
- If attacker has a higher level of success → Attacker deals damage
- If target/defender has a higher level of success → Target/defender deals damage
- If the level of success is a draw, the attacker deals damage.
- If both fail their roll, neither of them deals damage.

Apply any perk modifiers to the player’s attack if the enemy fails to fight back. If the perk is passive, apply automatically. If the perk is active, give the player the decision if they would like to activate the perk (e.g., Rapid Attack).

#### Decide Damage Points (等combat最终确定后要修改)
If Player successfully deals damage to Enemy, the damage point is calculated based on the attack success level.

- If successful → Damage Value based on weapon damage from weapon table.

At Extreme Level of Success when attacking:
- Impale = Max Damage + Max Damage Bonus + Roll Weapon Damage
- Blunt = Max Damage + Max Damage Bonus
Depending on the amount of damage and the initial health bar of either character, this could result in death of either character which would promptly end the battle or result in game over.

Once the above has been resolved and the enemy is still alive, then it would be their turn to attack, which the player can choose to either dodge or fight back.

### Flee:

Sometimes the wisest decision is to retreat. One can’t fight another day if they are dead, after all.

When the player decides to flee, all actors must make a **Constitution** roll:

- Roll Success: no change to their MOV stat.
- Roll Extreme Success: +1 to their MOV stat.
- Roll Fail: -1 to their MOV stat.

If the player’s MOV stat is ≥ enemy MOV stat, then they have successfully escaped. **Combat ends.**
If the player’s MOV stat is < enemy MOV stat, then they have failed to escape.
When the player fails to escape, it would automatically be the enemy’s turn.

Once the above has been resolved and the enemy is still alive, then it would be their turn to attack, which the player can choose to either dodge or fight back.


## Items:

Players can use items on their character to heal themselves or maybe give them a boost to even out the odds during battle. Player’s character will receive some of these items at the beginning of their journey (or find them while they explore the world).

### Example Items:

- First Aid: +1 HP
- Medicine: +1D3 HP

If the player decides to use an item, depending on the item being used, they may need to roll for its effects. Once that is complete, it would be the enemy’s turn.

Once the above has been resolved and the enemy is still alive, then it would be their turn to attack. which the player can choose to either dodge or fight back.

## If Enemy Moves First...
Enemey as the Attacker will always fight. Player can choose whether to dodge or fight back. 

### Player Dodges:

Simply compare the attacker’s chosen fighting skill against the target/defender’s dodge skill.
- If attacker has a higher level of success → Attacker deals damage
- If target/defender has a higher level of success → target/defender avoids damage
- If the level of success is a draw, the target/defender avoids damage.
- If both fail their roll, neither of them deals damage.

### Player Fights Back:

Simply compare the attacker’s chosen fighting skill against the target/defender’s chosen fighting skill.
- If attacker has a higher level of success → Attacker deals damage
- If target/defender has a higher level of success → target/defender deals damage
- If the level of success is a draw, the attacker deals damage.
- If both fail their roll, neither of them deals damage.

Note: that some enemies can attack multiple times, if so, just go back to and initiate the attack until they are finished.

Again depending on the damage, it may result in either character's death, exiting the battle or game over. 

If both actors are alive, then the loop starts again at until one of them is dead.

*Note: the perk list is in the appendix; feel free to check it out.*

## Combat Ending Condition
Once combat starts, it will only end when one of player and enemy is dead, or player successfully escapes.
