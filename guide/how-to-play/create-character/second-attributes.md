## 3. Secondary Attributes 
There are a number of attributes that are determined after you have worked out the investigator’s characteristics. These are Damage Bonus and Build, Hit Points, Move Rate, Sanity, and Magic Points. Additionally, you will need to determine a Luck value. 

- **Damage Bonus and Build**: Damage Bonus is how much extra damage your investigator inflicts when making a successful close combat (melee) attack. Build is a scale of combined size and strength used when making a “Fighting Maneuver”. Add your Regular STR and SIZ characteristics together and consult the Damage Bonus and Build Table. You’ll find boxes on the investigator sheet to write in the Build and Damage Bonus values.

- **Damage Bonus and Build Table**
>Example: Brian set his STR to 60 and his SIZ to 70, totaling 130. When he makes a successful physical attack, he deals an extra 1D4 points of damage (Damage Bonus). His Build is 1.

| STR + SIZ | Damage Bonus | Build |
| :-----| ----: | :----: |
| 2-64 | -2 | -2 |
| 65-84 | -1 | -1 |
| 85-124 | None | 0 |
| 125-164 | +1D4 | 1 |
| 165-204 | +1D6 | 2 |

- **Hit Points (HP)**
Hit Points are figured by adding SIZ and CON together, then dividing the total by ten and rounding down to the nearest whole number. As your investigator takes damage from combat or other events, your hit points will drop.

> Example: SIZ 50 and CON 50 totals 100; divided by ten, this gives 10 hit points. The investigator can suffer up to 10 points of damage before they fall unconscious and, possibly, die.

- **Move Rate (MOV)**
All human characters have a Move Rate of 8.

- **Sanity (SAN)**: measures your investigator’s ability to deal with the shock and corruption from exposure to alien and mind-bending horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos. Sometimes, when such things overcome your investigator, they lose Sanity points, reflecting the lingering effect of such trauma—see **Sanity**. Note that “Starting” SAN begins equal to POW, but may later rise or fall through play, and the “Insane” box is used to write in one-fifth of the “Starting” SAN value.

- **Magic Points (MP)**: used to cast a spell or some other magical effect. Magic function not available for Rolling Sagas for now.

- **Luck**: used to determine whether external circumstances are with or against your investigator (whether your investigator can find a lantern in a dark barn, and so on)
