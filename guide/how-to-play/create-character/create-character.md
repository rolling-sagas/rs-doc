In ready-made characters, occupations and the related characteristics and skills have been preset. By simply choosing the occupation you want, you can quick start the game in 10 seconds.

- ### Customize Your Own Character
 Wanna create a new occupation? Or modify existing occupations with different statistics? 

 That's what 'Custom' page is used for. 

Steps(会加图片说明):
1. Add occupation. 
2. Allocate characteristics and skill points. Secondary Attributes will be calculated automatically. 
3. Give your character a backstory.

Check *Call of Cthulhu: the 7th Edition* below if you'd like to know about the definitions and functions of  each part.
