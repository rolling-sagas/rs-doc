### Customize Your Own Character
Character's information is composed of:
1. **General Information**: your investigator’s name, age, gender, and occupation, as well as their birthplace and current residence. In *Call of Cthulhu*, an investigator’s occupation determines the skills they are most proffcient with.
2. **Characteristics**: there are eight characteristics used to measure Strength (STR), Constitution (CON), Size (SIZ), Dexterity (DEX), Appearance (APP), Education (EDU), Intelligence (INT), and Willpower (POW). Each of these has a “Regular” percentile value between 1 and 100; thus, STR 60 means Strength 60%. Note that there are two smaller boxes to the edge of each characteristic—the upper small box is half value (or “Hard” value, i.e. the Regular value divided by 2), while the lower small box is the one-fifth value (or “Extreme” value, i.e. the Regular value divided by 5). E.g. with STR 60, the upper box would be “30” (half of 60) and the lower box would be “12” (one-fifth of 60). See Skill Rolls and Difffculty Levels, page 10, for what these values mean in play. 
Each of the characteristics measures a certain attribute:
• **STR**: the raw physical power your investigator can bring to bear.
• **CON**: the health and hardiness of your investigator.
• **SIZ**: an abstracted value of your investigator’s height and weight.
• **DEX**: physical agility and speed.
• **APP**: the physical appeal or how “good looking” your investigator is.
• **EDU**: a measure of the knowledge that your investigator has accumulated through formal education or the venerated “school of hard knocks” (i.e. street smarts). 
• **INT**: a measure of your investigator’s cunning, problem solving, and ability to make leaps of logic and intuition. 
• **POW**: a combination of force of will, spirit, and mental stability. 

In addition, there there are four key values for an investigator—Hit Points (HP), Magic Points (MP), Luck (Luck), and Sanity (SAN). These values may go up and down in play. 

• **Hit Points (HP)**: when your investigator suffers damage, deduct damage points from hit points—at zero hit points your investigator falls unconscious and may die—see Hit Points, Wounds, and Healing, page 14. 
• **Magic Points (MP)**: used to cast a spell or some other magical effect. When spent, magic points regenerate at a rate of 1-point per hour. If a character uses up all of their magic points, any further expenditure is taken from their hit points (becoming physical damage)—see Corbitt’s Spells, page 31, in The Haunting for an example of how magic points are used. 
• **Luck**: used to determine whether external circumstances are with or against your investigator (whether your investigator can find a lantern in a dark barn, and so on)
• **Sanity (SAN)**: measures your investigator’s ability to deal with the shock and corruption from exposure to alien and mind-bending horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos. Sometimes, when such things overcome your investigator, they lose Sanity points, reflecting the lingering effect of such trauma—see Sanity. Note that “Starting” SAN begins equal to POW, but may later rise or fall through play, and the “Insane” box is used to write in one-fifth of the “Starting” SAN value.
