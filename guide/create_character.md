### Customize Your Own Character
Character's information is composed of:
1. **General Information**: your investigator’s name, age, gender, and occupation, as well as their birthplace and current residence. In *Call of Cthulhu*, an investigator’s occupation determines the skills they are most proffcient with.
2. **Characteristics**: in *Call of Cthulhu*, each character has 8 characteristics:

    • **Strength (STR)**: the raw physical power your investigator can bring to bear.
    • **Constitution (CON)**: the health and hardiness of your investigator.
    • **Size (SIZ)**: an abstracted value of your investigator’s height and weight.
    • **Dexterity (DEX)**: physical agility and speed.
    • **Appearance (APP)**: the physical appeal or how “good looking” your investigator is.
    • **Education (EDU)**: a measure of the knowledge that your investigator has accumulated through formal education or the venerated “school of hard knocks” (i.e. street smarts). 
    • **Intelligence (INT)**: a measure of your investigator’s cunning, problem solving, and ability to make leaps of logic and intuition. 
    • **Power (POW)**: a combination of force of will, spirit, and mental stability. 

Allocate the following values where you like among these eight characteristics: 40, 50, 50, 50, 60, 60, 70, 80. Each of these values is a percentage number, so deciding to put 70 into your investigator’s Strength means they have “STR 70%,” an above average score, meaning they are quite strong.

Half and Fifth Characteristic Values will be calculated automatically.

3. **Attributes**: your eight characteristics will decide key values for an investigator—Hit Points (HP), Magic Points (MP), Luck (Luck), and Sanity (SAN). These values may go up and down in play. These attributes will be calculated automatically after 8 characteristics have been allocated. 

- **Hit Points (HP)**: when your investigator suffers damage, deduct damage points from hit points—at zero hit points your investigator falls unconscious and may die—see **Hit Points, Wounds, and Healing**. 
- **Magic Points (MP)**: used to cast a spell or some other magical effect. Magic function not available for Rolling Sagas for now.
- **Luck**: used to determine whether external circumstances are with or against your investigator (whether your investigator can find a lantern in a dark barn, and so on)
- **Sanity (SAN)**: measures your investigator’s ability to deal with the shock and corruption from exposure to alien and mind-bending horrors of the Cthulhu Mythos. Sometimes, when such things overcome your investigator, they lose Sanity points, reflecting the lingering effect of such trauma—see **Sanity**. Note that “Starting” SAN begins equal to POW, but may later rise or fall through play, and the “Insane” box is used to write in one-fifth of the “Starting” SAN value.

- **Damage Bonus and Build**: Damage Bonus is how much extra damage your investigator inflicts when making a successful clo.

4. **Skills**
 This section lists all of the common skills available. Your investigator can attempt to use most of these skills using the “base value” noted in parentheses next to the skill, e.g. “Accounting (05%)” means that everyone has a 5% skill in accountancy. On the ready-made investigator sheets you can see that each character has increased values for certain skills (these higher values supersede the base values). Te ones with increased values are the skills your investigator is relatively profcient in; the higher the value, the more skilled they are.Note that there are two boxes to the right of each skill box—the middle box is half value (or “Hard” value, i.e. the Regular value divided by 2), while the box on the right is the one-fifth value (or “Extreme” value, i.e. the Regular value divided by 5). E.g. with a Charm skill of 50%, the middle box would be “25” (half of 50) and the box to the right would be “10” (one-ffth of 50). See Skill Rolls and Diffculty Levels, page 10, for what these values mean in play. 

 5. **Weapons**
Weapons: notes any weapons possessed by your investigator. 
Each weapon has an entry for its Regular, Hard, and 
Extreme skill values, the damage it can infict (usually a die roll), and the number of attacks (per round) it can be used; and, for firearms, its range, ammunition, and its malfunction number—see **Combat**.
