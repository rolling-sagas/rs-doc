# Proposal A

**Overview:** This proposal will focus on giving players the option to select from a wide selection of investigators. Each investigator will have a **locked** set of moves that disregards the equipment they have. It puts emphasis on collecting a wide variety of investigators each with a unique experience, all the while simplifying the equipment and inventory system.

In this proposal, we will have a large library of move sets (like Pokémon), magic moves, traits (passive perks), and can attach them to various characters. We can still allow players to create their own characters still by letting them choose the move sets, but I think that can be discussed further (since I think it takes away the uniqueness of premade characters).
