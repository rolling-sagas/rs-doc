# Inventory System

Overview: It is wonderful to find various items available in an adventure, but everyone will still need a place to store all those stuff somewhere. Thus, we have the **inventory system**. 

Not only does it help our player's character carry stuff in their imaginary backpack for future uses, it also has a limit designed to not over power these characters and take the fun out of the game (e.g. having 10 first aid kit).

## Weight Limit

This will be the inventory limit of a given character. This is calculated from their SIZE stat. 

- SIZE (kg) * 20% = MAX carry Weight

When the player character exceeds this limit, they will not be able to progress through the story until they resolve the weight issue?

OR

When the player character exceeds this limit, the game will whisper to the AI and generate content based on that. And the player must resolve the weight issue before proceeding with the story?
