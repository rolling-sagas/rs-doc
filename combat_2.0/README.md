# Combat Sytem 2.0

**Overview:** Given the recent change's in the game's direction, we will be implementing **3D** character models in the future. The purpose of the 3D modeled character is to enhance the player's experience with story immersion. This is achieved by introducing these characters into combat, where player's can **see** their character's **in action**, fighting against eldritch beasts and monstrosities. The use of 3D models allows us to include stylist combat animations that is unique and exciting. 

Below I will propose some ideas on what our combat could potentially look like.

## Combat System A: Turn-Based Tactical Combat

This combat system is modeled after **Darkest Dungeon 2**'s combat system. It enemy placement allows many elements in **Call of Cthulhu** to be implemented.
