# Ai Dungeon Updates

Overview: From Latest to Oldest

## 2025 Q1: Gauntlet


### Story/Text Model: **Wayfarer Large** Llama 3.3 70b

This update's main focus is improving on their already **existing** models and making them better for story telling. They are really leaning towards **violence in story telling** so that player's can **feel dangers and threats** in the world in which they are adventuring in.

They also emphasized on how to make choices matter more during a play through. 

### Story/Text Model: Dynamic Large

Has the ability to switch between AI models so that the story feels fresh and unpredictable.

They said that many of their players are already switching models to break repetition, so they are trying to make a model that doesn't require manual switching. 

**They also recommend

*there are 2 more models but it's just some minor updates, nothing major.*


## 2024 Q4: Forge

### Story/Text Model: Madness

This AI model also focuses on violence, horror, gore etc. They really wanted to make sure player's can create a story as dark as they want. 

*After testing it out, I find **Wayfarer Small** much more capable of violence and gore than Madness*

### Image Models

Since I don't have credits, I do not know how good these images are. But I don't think its anything special given that they didn't talk much about this update.


## Dev Log

### Jan 23, 2025

Their lead narrative is now focused on making sure stories that are generated are not "safe". Story needs conflicts, dangers, and adversity, and that is what they are pushing for. They believe that conflict will produce interesting choices, a these choices should have meaningful consequences. 

They are also trying to emphasize "emergent story telling", but I am not sure how stable or consistent the result is.
