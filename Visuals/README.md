# Profile Characters & Avatars

**Overview:** Users using our platform will have their own profile along with an avatar to represent themselves. These avatars can be altered through the purchases of cosmetics, accessories for the player to express themselves. This is also a region for us to create a market place for the players to create, buy, and sell these cosmetics.

In this document, I will propose a few ideas in which we can be implement to our current platforms architecture.

I will also cover where visuals will be present, how it will bring value and importance to our platform's user experience.

## User Profile

Upon signing up for an account on RollingSagas, users will automatically create a profile on our platform.

![UserProfile](/Visuals/images/Screenshot%202024-08-09%20171024.png)

Current: 
- Create a user name
- Create a user handle
- Upload a user profile picture
- Self Introduction

Although our current form is simple, straightforward, and users can still have an image to express themselves, *It doesn't put any emphasis on **roleplaying**, since immersion is lacking without visuals.*

Since our product will be built similar to **Roblox**, providing a platform for users to create and develop their own game (TTRPG), it is imperative that player's can **express** themselves when they play/enter a **scenario**. 

![RobloxProfile](/Visuals/images/微信图片_20240809172307.png)

I believe we can implement this onto our user profile page with something like this *(subject to change for better design)*:

![NewUserProfile](/Visuals/images/New%20profile.png)

**Orange Box:** This is where we can place the user's **avatar**.
- Full Body
- User's chosen **idle** pose

**Red Box:** This is where we can place the **store** button.
- Has its own unique icon

**Pink Box:** Edit button, allows the user to change their character's cosmetic to whichever item they currently possess. Along with poses and stances.

**Green Box:** Add a preset cosmetics tab, allows users to quickly interchange between cosmetic sets/designs that best fit their upcoming game session.

## Avatar

The avatar will be one of the centre piece in player's experience with our game/platform.
It allows the player to:
- Better **immerse** themselves as the character (roleplaying)
- **Express** themselves online to emphasize on their character and personality
- **Escape** reality for a moment and become **someone else** in their fantasy

### Design

There can be a multitude of designs for the player's avatar, from pixel art to anime to abstract, it all depends on the creator's imagination.

e.g.

![DarkestDungeon](/Visuals/images/ddkngiht.gif)

![PixelCharacter](/Visuals/images/suga-suga-emu-black.gif)

![SlayTheSpire](/Visuals/images/slay%20the%20spire%20character.png)

![Anime](/Visuals/images/fortnite-zuko-bundle-804888d.jpg)

![OilPainting](/Visuals/images/5518-studios-detective-color2.jpg)


The importance of different art style overlaps with the *images* of the *scenarios/story* created by the player. If the story is set in a cyberpunk world, the creator may want everything to be in 8 bit style or some unique art style.

Since users will be popualting the stories with their **own** avatar, they can choose to project themselves with whatever clothes/skin their character is wearing **OR**, spend a few Jelly Rolls and purchase one of the creators **story specific skins**.

![IntoTheSpider-Verse](/Visuals/images/into%20the%20spider-verse%20other%20spiderman.webp)

*Even if the user uses a skin design that is vastly different from the creator's world, it would still work. It's common enough for different art style to clash and co-exist on a single frame.*


*(It is important to note that there is still a wide variety of cosmetics available for free in different style in the market place, but there are also certain designs that require Jelly Rolls to purchase.)*

## **How do we make sure that all *creators* make consistently sized characters???**

Like *Roblox* and various other games with 3D or 2D models, we will introduce a basic form of **skeleton** for the avatar. 

![Skeleton](/Visuals/images/motion-capture.jpg)
- The skeleton should always face **RIGHT**.

### ***Dragonbones**,  **Spine**, or **Aesprite** may be a good place to start for creators?*

With it, creators can even give their *story specific* characters poses for deeper roleplaying!

e.g.

![RobloxPirate](/Visuals/images/Pirate%20idle.png)
*Here we have a pirate idle pose*



![RobloxNinja](/Visuals/images/Ninja%20idle.png)
*Here we have a ninja idle pose*

![SlayTheSpireCombat](/Visuals/images/slay%20the%20spire%20character.png)

Creators can create anything they want as long its built ontop of the skeleton in which we provide them with.



### Idle Poses & General Poses

We should prepare and provide a good selection of poses that will be available in the store. As for the complexity of the poses, we can give creators the tools to make it more complex and have them price it themselves. Of course, we as a team will also provide a good selection of cosmetics for the players to select from.


![ElanaIdle](/Visuals/images/elena%20idle.gif)

*^Something like this would naturally be priced higher*


![Animegirl](/Visuals/images/maid%20idle.gif)
*^This would be priced lower*


![SlayTheSpire3](/Visuals/images/slay%20the%20spire%20enemy%20gif.gif)
*^Simple idle animations is enouraged*



### Cosmetic Market

All cosmetics and accessories will be concentrated in **1** place: **The Market of Oddities**

Users can browse, try-on, and purchase any cosmetics they like similar to *Roblox*.

e.g.

![RobloxCosmeticStore](/Visuals/images/roblox%20market%20place.jpg)

*The market place will include cosmetics made by RollingSagas and user designed items.*

*We can first set up the price, for items of different tier so users and creators have a point of reference when pricing their skins.*

Users can also click into the details of the item and see who **created it**, and then through there access into their page which may have more cosmetics made by this person or possibly stories written by them too.

#### Visuals

Apple webpage and e-eommerce has long been a good reference for webpage design, I believe we can implment certain concepts from it that aligns with our vision and current design:  

![AppleCompStore](/Visuals/images/Apple%20Computer%20Store.png)

*I think the items can appear with texts inside the bubble and in higher definition.*

![ApplePreview](/Visuals/images/Apple%20comp%20preview.png)

*Once the user clicks or taps on an item, a small window will pop up for a preview on what it could look like on the user's character.*
-  ***Red Box:** This is where the character would be situated, and also where the "buy" button will be located.* 



There are different categories that separate the items for ease of browsing.

Furthermore, content creators can display their **story specific** cosmetics on their **scenario/story** page. When a user selects a *story specific character*, they will see a **preview** of user's character.

e.g.

![ScenarioPage](/Visuals/images/Story%20specific%20character%20cosmetic.png)

This allows users to quickly *get into character* before they dive deep into a story.


## Combat

Combat will be a **major** mechanic that will further emphasize the purpose and importance of incorporating an avatar. This is where player's will best display their unique characters and interact with enemies while they role player as the character. 

![SlayTheSpireCombat](/Visuals/images/slay%20the%20spire%20character.png)

![DarkestDungeonCombat](/Visuals/images/darkestdungeon%20combat.jpg)

*Will need a section where creators can add backgrounds to their combat setting.*

In these two examples, we can see that **player's** character(s) are battle ready on the **left** side and facing **enemies** on the **right**. In combination with simple animation and special effects mechanic like "Slay the Spire", it should be easy enough to test and implement.
