# Cyberoll Story Feedback

General Issues: 

1. Stories all read the same. The use of words, the way the story is generated all sounds the same across all stories. There isn't much uniqueness to each story if it all reads the same. 

2. AI has a general problem with the concept of "knowledge". It would often reveal names of NPC even before the player meets or learn of their name.

3. Strange conflicting choices. Where one choice makes the other one sound strange. 

4. The choices generated by AI are often very similar.

## Echoes of the Ninth
- Who hired me as a private investigator? 
- Revealing Marianna's name before the player learns of it. [General Issue 2]
- Sometimes choices are similar but conflicting (e.g. 1. open the box, 2. ask Marianna HOW to open the box) [General Issue 3]
- "Chords of the Abyss" Image not found when looking for a keyhole (Most likely a typo for image names)
- '_summary:_' <--- AI is misreading your prompts/ printing it incorrectly
- Need auto 'skill checks' when appropriate. 
- I think restarting from character creation after dying is too punishing.

## Nightmare Arena
- Chapter 1 can use some editing to smooth out some rough edges. Potentially additional prompts or instructions for the debt collector and providing a descriptive action of HOW the challenge was accepted.

![challengeaccepted](///cyberoll_feedback/images/squid%20game,%20accept%20challenge%20issue.png) 
- Chapter 2 jumps right into the game, but it is not explained how the player got there. Perhaps they were kidnapped out of nowhere? Maybe a different person knocked on their door?
- Strange dialogues
- Create more variability in other characters backstory. I played a few times and it seems these NPC all behave similarly and said something extremely vague. (My point is, if none of these characters are gonna behave differently from one another and aren't willing to share about their backstory, then there really isn't a point putting it here.)
- Provide an option to just sit and wait alone for the game to start.
- Chapter 3 some skill checks uses the wrong skill
- Should provide options for player's to choose from how they approach these challenges. Instead of skill "checks", provide skill "choice", that way player's can play their character the way they want to play it. (e.g. An agile character would bet on their strength, instead, they would take advantage of the dexterity to get around obstacles.)

- Chapter 4 riddle game, R'lyeh
![wrongskillcheck](/cyberoll_feedback/images/squid%20game,%20wrong%20skill%20used%20in%20skills%20checks.png)
- The luck roll is ridiculous, after solving the riddle renders the riddle pointless, as my ability to solve riddle is not rewarded nor is it important, because a failed roll will kill me instantly.
![luckroll](/cyberoll_feedback/images/squid%20game,%20luck%20roll.png) 
- Add 'text input box' will definitely enhance the experience
- Need skill checks for dialogue options in "before the storm".
- "Game on" Rule is not explained to the player, I don't know what the **Goal** or **win state** of the game.
- "Riddle of the Abyss" provide text input for answers?
- In "Fear", I didn't understand the luck roll, and why it required luck.

## White Christmas
- Chapter 1
- Chapter 2
- Image not loading in chapter 3, feast near the end. 
- I think 4 action choices would enhance the experience
- I went from chapter2 to chapter4, skipping chapter3.
- "Gift of Damnation", image cannot load.
- Chapter "prince of sin" is not displaying any of the images properly
- 

## The Haunting
- Not given any choices on how to interact with Mr. Dooly
- always providing 4 choices would enhance the experience
- "second floor" image not found.
- On second floor, give action options instead of forced skill check. 
- If i am on the second floor, how is there door beneath the bed and a set of stairs that go to the basement?
- Maybe give a choice on staring at the painting?
![paintsanity](/cyberoll_feedback/images/the%20haunting,%202nd%20floor,%20sanity%20check.png)
- Images not loading for "The Final Fight" chapter
- Strange skill check
![skillcheck](/cyberoll_feedback/images/the%20haunting,%20the%20final%20fight,%20strange%20skill%20check.png)
![skillcheck2](/cyberoll_feedback/images/the%20haunting,%20the%20final%20fight,%20confusing%20skill%20check.png)
- The whole "Final Fight" just doesn't feel fair? I make a successful roll to attack, but forced to make another roll to land the hit.


## The Barnacle Hamlet Enigma
- Intro doesn't tell what the goal / purpose of the player character. Why is he in the Hamlet, as this would affect what actions or decisions one would take.
- Why am I visiting Barnacle Hamlet?
- Chapter 1 doesn't give me choices to act, instead I am just going along for a ride
![nochoice](/cyberoll_feedback/images/hamlet,%201st%20chapter,%20no%20choices%20given.png)
- Images not loading in chapter "Final"
- Chapter 2 ending doesn't connect with chapter 3's ending.
