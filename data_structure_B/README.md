**Overview:** Instead of investigators having a **locked** move set, players can equip and unequip different equipment (weapons, spells) to acquire different move set.

This proposal focuses on single character development. Players will be incentivised to build up a few characters and have it equip the weapons they best fit their character's stat. This also allows for more **variability** in one character, like making a small build adjustment, **personalization**.
