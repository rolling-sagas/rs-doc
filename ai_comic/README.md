# AI Comic Research

**Overview:** There are in fact multiple products online that are also doing *AI COMIC/MANGA* but most of them lack image generation quality. Most of the products generate low quality images with expressionless characters, easily revealing their product as AI and lowers user experience. 

Nonetheless, by combining the strengths of multiple products, it is possible to form something that is enjoyable.

# Notable Products

## Dashtoon

**Site:** https://dashtoon.com/

![DashtoonHome](/ai_comic/images/dashtoon%20home%20page.png)
*Main page. Users can immediately read the content or begin creating*


![DashtoonStudio](/ai_comic/images/dashtoon%20studio%20page.png)
*The studio page is the creation page. There are tutorials too.*

**Overview:** Dashtoon is one of the few products currently that gives the users **nearly** all the tools for the users to build their own comic. The only tool that it lacks is **panelling**.

### Creation Process & Tools

![FirstStep](/ai_comic/images/dashtoon%20creation%201st%20page.png)
*First step is to write a prompt or the story in which the user would like to create*

![SecondStep](/ai_comic/images/Anime%20style%20select%201.png)
![SecondStep2](/ai_comic/images/anime%20style%20select%202.png)
*Next is selecting an **art style**.*

Dashtoon currently has **12 different** art style to choose from (8 of them are still experimental).

![CharacterAddRemove](/ai_comic/images/dashtoon%20character%20add%20remove.png)
*Based on the prompts/text the user has written, it would create the mentioned characters (or potential characters) in your story. Users can also add or remove characters on this screen (note that users can add or remove characters anytime)*

Once the characters are confirmed, it would generate a panel with images, texts, and essentially a comic/manga (below).


### Modifying Tools

Dashtoon provides a wide array of tools to modify and edit the generated **texts** and **images** so the user may create the ideal comic they want to make.

![Screenplay](/ai_comic/images/dashtoon%20creation%20screen%20dragon.png)

**Orange:** The user's story prompts will then be generated on a comic panel, with the described images. Texts will be automatically added onto the story, but can still be edited (Red and Blue Box). 

**Red:** User's can modify the image prompt here and regenerate at a cost. Users can change the image with specific commands or emphasis:
    - Location: Something specific about the environment
    - Time
    - Camera Angle: The angle of the shot the image is in.
    - Camera Shot: The type of shot the image is caught in.

Users may also delete, duplicate, or leave a comment/note for the panel if they wish to do so. Once the changes are made, they are free to regenerate the image. 

**Blue:** This box affects character generation in the image. If there is a need for a specific character to appear in the image, then the user can add them here. Furthermore, they may also add **dialogue**, **narration**, or **thought** (which essentially changes the text bubble).

After making the desired changes, users can again, regenerate the image.

**Pink:** The **Editor** is where I believe Dashtoon shine so much more than other products is that it provides a wide range of tools for the users to freely edit their comic/manga they had just created. 

- Image Resizing: Users can resize the image, changing its **frame** if they so desire, so it has more of a comic/manga effect.

*e.g*
![MandyManga1](/ai_comic/images/mandy%20comic%201.png)


- Text Bubble Edit: Users can adjust the text bubble's position, angle etc. so it best fits the characters position.


- Character Edit: Users can edit the character's prompt here and change their appearance. 

- Character Retouch: Users can touch up specific region of an image to increase consistency of the character across panels. 

*e.g*
![MandyCharacter](/ai_comic/images/mandy%20comic%20hair%20change.png)

They have additional wide range of tools as highlighted in **Red** and **Green**:

### Creators

Similar to **Roblox**, content creators on Dashtoon has their own community with variety of perks and benefits. Users may apply whenever they are interested.

**Those selected into the creators program receive a free upgrade to their PRO PLAN.**

### Conclusion

Dashtoon most definitely has the most sophisticated tools created for the user to create and build their own comic/manga, but the image quality and style is different from what we are looking for. Despite of that, the wide range of tools they provide for the user is something worth noticing and should be implemented to our own platform if we wish to do so. 

**Pro:** 

- Wide range of tools
- Many different image/art style
- Can create very specific image with camera angles (user has more control over the image)
- Has a multi-step creation process
- Tutorials on how to maximize the potential of the AI Comic Creator

**Con:**

- Image art style and design is poor (low quality and also not what we are looking for)
- Complexity of it requires time investment to be skilled at (but still much easier than real drawing)
- Is only limited to **web comic** panel format 
- **Their readable online comics are not all AI Generated, it appears that many users are taking advantage of their paneling tools to make their own comic.**



**Regardless, I think they are still early in their initial stages and will increase their art style image generation selection and paneling choices.** 




## AI Comic Generator (ACG)

**Site:** https://aicomicgenerator.net/playground

![ACGHomepage](/ai_comic/images/ACGhomepage.png)


**Overview:** ACG adheres to the classic American style comic with its panelling style. Easy to use and quickly generates images. 

### Creation Process and Tools

![ACGPlayground](/ai_comic/images/ACGplayground.png)

ACG has a much more basic creation process than Dashtoon, but has much less tools given to the user.

**Blue:** Users can select their desired art style for the images they want to generate.

**Green:** Panel Options, which they have only **4**.

**Red:** Caption/Narration for the image created.

**Purple:** Text/story prompts for the image generation and character prompts.

*e.g 1*
![ACGSoccer](/ai_comic/images/ACGsoccer.png)

*e.g 2*
![ACGPolice](/ai_comic/images/ACGspecialforces.png)

### Modifying Tools

Users are allowed to click a **redraw** or **edit** button on one of the images if it doesn't fit their narrative.

- Edit button allows the user to change the image prompt.

### Conclusion

AI Comic Generator is quick and easy to use but lacks the tools for users to fully shape the visual representation of the story in which they want to create. 

**Pros:**
- Easy to use 
- Panelling is aligned with what we are looking for
- Modifying tools to edit image prompts if it is not to the users liking
- The comic style is aligned with what we are looking for

**Cons:**
- Lack of tools for users really shape what they want
- Limited panel/layout selection
- Lack of consistency for the images 

ACG definitely has room for improvement, especially with the tools that can be given to the users. Additional panel/layout options would be a great addition. 


## CYBERPUNK MOMOTARO (Peach John)

**Overview:** Cyberpunk Momotaro retells a classic Japanese folklore in a cyberpunk dystopian setting. It is also the first AI manga that was published, in full color, and took the creator 6 weeks to create. 

![peachjohn3](/ai_comic/images/cyberpunkpeachjohn3.png)


![peachjohn2](/ai_comic/images/cyberpunkpeachjohn2.png)

The mangaka, **Rootport**, used Midjourney to generate the desired images he needed to create his story, and uses photoshop to extract the images and scenes and combine them together to make the manga.

The artist also noted that to overcome to **character consistency** issue, he gave distinct features to each character so that readers could recognize them not based on how they look, but what they wear (red kimono), unique features (cat ears), or hair color (pink hair). That way regardless how minor the changes of their faces are, readers can quickly recognize which character is speaking without any confusion.
